        <p>MUA is an extremely effective tool for chronic pain relief, and most of those who qualify experience improved range of motion, improved outlook and the ability to continue rehabilitation to help the scar tissues heal. To see if you're a good candidate for MUA, answer this short questionnaire. If you answer yes to all of these questions, MUA may be right for you. Contact us at 1.844.MUA.DOCS or email address for more information.</p>
