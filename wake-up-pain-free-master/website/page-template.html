        <h1>What is MUA?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Manipulation Under Anesthesia is a non-invasive, multi-specialty approach to treating chronic pain related to spinal dysfunction caused by the infiltration of scar tissue in an incomplete healing process.</p>

    <div id="content">
      <hr>
      <p>Before fully understanding MUA, it's helpful to understand what's causing your pain. When a person has an injury to any structure in the spine (a joint, cartilage, ligament, tendon, disc, muscle, etc.) the body naturally heals itself by forming scar tissue (think of an internal scar) which is thicker, less flexible, shorter and less bio-mechanically efficient than the original tissue. Scar tissue often forms as a short 'knot' in the tissue as opposed to the long, straight lines of the original tissue. The spine and muscles become overly tight, have limited function and become extremely tender to the touch, resulting in unbearable and intractable pain.
      </p>

      <p>Most treatments are aimed at removing pain with pain killers and reducing spasms with muscle relaxants instead of addressing the actual source of the pain. Simply treating the patient’s symptoms leads to improper, incomplete  healing and recurrent injuries. For example, 20-40% of all herniated disc related back surgeries fail because the pain was improperly treated. It's often the scar tissue causing the pain, not the disc itself. Properly identifying the source of the pain and then treating it appropriately is key successfully eliminating pain.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is why MUA can succeed after other techniques have failed. When the patient is under a light sedation (the same that dentists use for apprehensive patients), we can work deeply on these scar tissues without any pain or resistance from the patient. By stretching, massaging and adjusting these tissues, we can promote the remodeling of this scar tissue into a longer, more flexible tissue. By positively altering the structure, we can reduce pain and disability.

          <p id="footer-text">Manipulation Under Anesthesia ("MUA") is a multi-specialty approach to treating chronic musculo-skeletal pain. A licensed physician and a licensed chiropractor are both involved in the overall procedure – the physician is solely responsible for determining the medical appropriateness and ordering, as well as administering of anesthesia while the chiropractor is solely responsible for performing the necessary manipulations while the patient is "asleep." Patients should be aware that there is no direct or indirect financial relationship between the physician and chiropractor who are involved in the MUA procedure. The physician is a Board-certified anesthesiologist and the chiropractor is a licensed practitioner who has received specialized training in how to perform MUA.</p>
