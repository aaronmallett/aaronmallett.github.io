        <h1>Our Process</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Unlike other treatments, our process allows for a lot of flexibility. Since most of our patients require 2 or 3 consecutive sessions, it is extremely common for someone to fly out, have the procedure and fly back over just a few days. We select patients based on their medical history and imaging studies, so there’s no need to fly in for a consultation or exam before your procedure. See a more detailed overview of our process below.</p>

          <p><strong>Consultation</strong></p>

        <div class="process-box col-md-4">
          <p><strong>Recovery Period</strong></p>
          <p>Some patients may be quite sore immediately following the procedure, but they will still report an improvement in their overall range of motion and optimism right away.</p>

        <div class="process-box col-md-4">
          <p><strong>No Improvement</strong></p>
          <p>While it is extremely rare, sometimes MUA cannot relieve your pain. This can occur in patients with severely damaged structures. Our highly selective qualification process helps to ensure that this outcome doesn't happen often.
