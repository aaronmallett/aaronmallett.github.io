          <p id="footer-text">Manipulation Under Anesthesia ("MUA") is a multi-specialty approach to treating chronic musculo-skeletal pain. A licensed physician and a licensed chiropractor are both involved in the overall procedure – the physician is solely responsible for determining the medical appropriateness and ordering, as well as administering of anesthesia while the chiropractor is solely responsible for performing the necessary manipulations while the patient is "asleep." Patients should be aware that there is no direct or indirect financial relationship between the physician and chiropractor who are involved in the MUA procedure. The physician is a Board-certified anesthesiologist and the chiropractor is a licensed practitioner who has received specialized training in how to perform MUA.</p>
