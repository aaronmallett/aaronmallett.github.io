      <h2>Full Privacy Policy</h2><br><br>

www.KlassChiropractic.com, www.WakeUpPainFree.com, and Klass Chiropractic P.C. (collectively, “Company”) is committed to the privacy and dignity of our community. We take your privacy seriously and are dedicated to handling any personal information you provide with the utmost care and respect.<br><br>

This Privacy Policy is designed to answer questions you may have regarding our privacy policy and principles. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.<br><br>

<strong>What type of information does the Privacy Policy cover?</strong><br>
As used in this Privacy Policy, “<strong>Company</strong>” includes www.WakeUpPainFree.com, www.KlassChiropractic.com and Klass Chiropractic P.C. (collectively, “Company”), its subsidiaries/affiliated/contracted entities, contracted physicians, other health care professionals, employees, and contractors, including any professional entity that may render services related to our website(s), and all of their subsidiary and affiliated entities and companies. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Company does not own or control or to people that Company does not employ or manage. Company is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “we,” “us,” “our” and “ourselves.” Users of this website and our services may be referred to in this Privacy Policy as “users,” “you” or “your.”<br><br>

Unless otherwise stated, this Privacy Policy applies only to personally identifiable information collected on the Company website, through Company’s e-mail system, through audio and/or video teleconferencing services, two-way audio and/or video consultation (which will not create or constitute a professional relationship), and/or through any and all other electronic means of communication utilized by Company in relation to its online services. It does not apply to any other information collected by Company by any other means.<br><br>

This Privacy Policy applies to personally identifiable information collected on and after the date that this Privacy Policy is posted. However, for any Company users who visited, accessed or reviewed our website prior to this date, we will apply this Privacy Policy to personally identifiable information associated with that user only if the user accepts the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. <br><br>

The term “personally identifiable information” means information that identifies a particular individual or enables a party to contact an individual, and includes the individual’s name, postal address, e-mail address and telephone number. Personally identifiable information is sometimes referred to in this Privacy Policy as “personal information.” <br><br>

The terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to all applicable laws and regulations.<br><br>

<strong>How do we collect the personally identifiable information of our users?</strong><br>
Company may collect certain personally identifiable information through a variety of means and sources about users who visit, submit information through or otherwise use the Company website or services. We collect such information in the following manners:<br><br>

<strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong><br>
Much of the personally identifiable information we receive comes directly from users who are interested in signing up with the website services or obtaining information from and/or setting up an appointment with us in connection with the services we offer. We collect personal information when you complete and submit a form through the Company website in order to contact us for an appointment or general inquiry, or when you e-mail us. We will also collect information as part of the services or information provided during the audio and/or video teleconference consultation itself, and, to the extent applicable, through other telephonic communications. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the personally identifiable information that you submit to us. Inaccurate information will affect your experience when using the Company website or our services and our ability to contact you as described in this Privacy Policy. We may also collect other types of information (non-identifiable information), such as gender, age, personal interests and medical or health-related information that we may associate with personally identifiable information. <br><br>

<strong>Information Collected Through Technology</strong><br>
We may collect information through technology to make our website more useful to you and to track user web activity and interests. Our website may use “cookies,” which are pieces of information a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website, for a variety of purposes. For example, when you return to our website after logging in, cookies may provide information to the site so that the site will remember who you are. We may also use information collected through web beacons, which are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of websites, to analyze the traffic patterns on our website, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts or pages of our website. We may also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send to our users to determine whether our users have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails.<br><br>

You may engage in certain transactions without submitting an inquiry, consultation request forms or emails through our website. In such cases, we may gather personally identifiable information, which may include, but is not limited to, your computer’s IP address.<br><br>

We may manage and place advertisements on our website on behalf of third parties referred to herein as “network advertisers.” We may also use cookies and other technology to collect information when you click on or move your cursor over one of these banner advertisements. <br><br>

Please note that once you have clicked on any such advertisement and have left our website, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on its website. Advertisers or other third party companies will not have access to our cookies or other information-gathering technology.<br><br>

<strong>Information That We Collect from Others</strong><br>
We may supplement personally identifiable information that we have collected directly from our users with other information that we obtain from third parties. If and when we associate any information that we obtained from third parties with personally identifiable information that we have collected under this Privacy Policy, we will treat the acquired information exactly like the information that we collected ourselves. <br><br>

<strong>How is personally identifiable information used?</strong><br>
We will never rent, sell, disseminate or share personal information about you with non-affiliated companies or third parties, except when we have your permission or under the circumstances set forth in detail below.<br><br>

Personally identifiable information collected may be shared within and used by Company for several purposes. For example, Company may use your personal information to send you promotional materials about goods and services, including special offers and promotions, either offered by Company or offered by third parties (sent by Company on behalf of these third parties). These promotional materials may be sent to you by postal mail, e-mail or other means. We may also use your personal information for “Operational Uses,” such as to complete transactions requested by you (for example, your purchase of our services) or to send you administrative communications. Finally, Company may take your personally identifiable information that is associated with other information about you (i.e. demographic information including age, sex, etc.) and make it non-personally identifiable (“non-identifiable”) by removing all personally identifiable characteristics, such as your name and e-mail address.<br><br>

At times, Company may engage or otherwise contract with companies to help deliver products or services that you request from Company. Examples of these companies may include packaging, printing, mailing or delivery companies. In these instances, there may be a need to share your information with these companies to fulfill your requests. Unless stated otherwise, these companies are allowed to gather, receive and use your information only for the purposes described in this paragraph or as required by law.<br><br>

Company may contract with a third party to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. Website tracking services help websites to measure the effectiveness of advertising and how visitors use a website through the use of web beacons and cookies provided by such company. The type of information we may collect includes, but is not limited to, the pages visited and links clicked by users. By supplementing our records, this information would help us to learn things such as what pages are most useful and attractive to our visitors and which of our tools and information most interest our visitors. Although the third party company would log the information coming from our website on our behalf, we would control how that data may and may not be used.<br><br>

Company will disclose personal information when it believes in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, such as to comply with a court order or subpoena; or (b) will help to enforce any of our Terms of Use, protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you, and/or protect the safety and security of our website, or the Company, and/or third parties, including the safety and security of property that belongs to professional entities rendering services related to Company’s website or third parties.<br><br>

<strong>What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personally identifiable information?</strong><br>
With regard to personal information that you have provided under this Privacy Policy, you may exercise your opt-out choices available to you (if any and where applicable) by contacting us directly as described below.<br><br>

Please keep in mind that any opt-out choices you make will not apply in situations where: (a) you either have made, simultaneously make or later make a specific request for information from Company’s website; (b) Company uses your personal information for “Operational Uses” (as described above); or (c) Company collects your personally identifiable information under any of the provisions above. <br><br>

If you do not exercise your opt-out choices upon sign up/registration or initial log-in at our website, it may take up to ninety (90) days for your opt-out choices to be fully effective. Our systems may require time to update, and promotional mailings, by e-mail or otherwise, using personal information shared before your opt-out may already be in process. Thus, you might continue to receive promotional materials from Company based upon the personal information you have provided under this Privacy Policy for up to ninety (90) days. <br><br>

<strong>What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?</strong><br>
The security and confidentiality of your information is of utmost importance to us. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect user information from unauthorized access and improper use. For example, we limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.<br><br><br><br>



<strong>Children</strong><br><br>

We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The Company website is not designed or intended to attract children under the age of 18. Company does not collect personal information from any person we actually know is under the age of 18.

The parent or guardian assumes full responsibility for ensuring that any registration information is kept secure and that the information submitted is accurate. The parent or guardian also assumes full responsibility for the interpretation and use of any information or suggestions provided through Company or its website for the minor.<br><br>

<strong>Company’s Commitment to Your Protected Health Information</strong><br>

          <p id="footer-text">Manipulation Under Anesthesia ("MUA") is a multi-specialty approach to treating chronic musculo-skeletal pain. A licensed physician and a licensed chiropractor are both involved in the overall procedure – the physician is solely responsible for determining the medical appropriateness and ordering, as well as administering of anesthesia while the chiropractor is solely responsible for performing the necessary manipulations while the patient is "asleep." Patients should be aware that there is no direct or indirect financial relationship between the physician and chiropractor who are involved in the MUA procedure. The physician is a Board-certified anesthesiologist and the chiropractor is a licensed practitioner who has received specialized training in how to perform MUA. Klass Chiropractic, P.C. does not guarantee or warrant that patients will actually ‘wake up pain

free.’ This is simply a marketing phrase to convey to potential patients who are appropriately 

screened and treated through MUA that they are reasonably likely to see a reduction in their 

pain over time.</p>
