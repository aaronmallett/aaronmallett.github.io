      <p><strong>I’ve never heard of MUA.  What exactly is it?</strong><br>
        MUA is an in depth process explained in detail <a href="about.html">here</a>. To put simply, MUA is a conservative multi-specialty approach to treating chronic spinal pain and motion restriction using minor doses of anesthesia. The use of light sedation allows for deep tissue massage and stretching that would not be possible otherwise due to unbearable pain.
      </p>

      <p><strong>How do I know if MUA is right for me?</strong><br>
        If you’ve suffered from spine related pain and can never seem to find relief, then MUA might be right for you. Call us to discuss your situation. After reviewing your medical history and records, we will know if MUA is right for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>I don’t live in the area. Should I still consider MUA with Dr. Klass?</strong><br>
        Absolutely! Dr. Klass is one of the leading certified MUA doctors in the country. He has been studying MUA for over 7 years and has even taught under the MUA Pioneer, Dr. Gordon. Our procedure allows for a lot of flexibility. Since most of our patients require 2 or 3 consecutive sessions, it is extremely common for someone to fly out, have the procedure and fly back over just a few days. We select patients based on their medical history and imaging studies, so there’s no need to fly in for a consultation or exam before your procedure.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What should I expect from MUA?</strong><br>
        In order for you to know exactly what to expect from our MUA procedures, we’ve outlined our process in detail <a href="ourprocess.html">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>How many procedures will I need?</strong><br>
        Depending on the severity of your case, patients may need 1-5 procedures (most require 2-3). As soon as we see an improvement of 80% or better after any procedure, you will be released for post care.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Does insurance cover MUA?</strong><br>
        We provide MUA procedures on a cash basis. We currently do not work with insurance companies. However, we <i>are</i> working with United Medical Credit to offer payment plans to our patients. To apply for financing through United Medical Credit, <a href="https://www.unitedmedicalcredit.com/start-an-application/?pid=001E00000167agy" target="_blank">fill out their online application</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What is the process from beginning to end?</strong><br>
        We’ve outlined our process in detail <a href="ourprocess.html">here</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Will I feel 100% better after the MUA?</strong><br>
        In some cases, yes! Some patients feel a significant improvement immediately after the MUA. However, most patients report a recovery time where they feel sore and inflamed. Even those with a recovery time often report experiencing a noticeable improvement in their range of motion. Unfortunately, in rare and extreme cases, patients may not see any improvement from MUA.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>My doctor says he doesn’t know much about MUA. Does this mean I shouldn’t do it?
</strong><br>
        Of course not! MUA is a commonly misunderstood procedure and most medical professionals don’t know a lot about it. We’d be happy to discuss MUA with your doctor. Or you can refer him or her to our Professionals (link to Professionals page) page for more information.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What conditions respond well to MUA?</strong><br>
        In short, MUA can relieve any pain caused by scar tissue that has formed within spinal tissues such as muscles, tendons, ligaments, joints and discs. It is performed for the treatment of chronic and recurrent spine and extremity pain, fibroblastic proliferative changes (scar tissue), chronic muscle spasms, failed back surgery syndromes, herniated discs and un-resolving lower back pain, neck pain and headaches. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Are there any contraindications to MUA?</strong><br>
        Yes. They include: infectious bone disease, acute fractures, acute inflammatory arthritis (i.e. gout or rheumatoid), tuberculosis of the bone, gonorrheal spinal arthritis, osteoporosis, “direct” manipulation of old compression fractures, uncontrolled diabetic neuropathy, syphilitic articular or periarticular lesions, evidence of cord or caudal compression by tumor or disc herniations, widespread staphylococcal or streptococcal infection, respiratory infections, metastatic bone disease, any forms of malignancy or metastasis, prior history of stroke, infection of the joint or disc area or space, osteogenesis imperfecta, vertebral artery syndrome, abdominal aortic aneurysm, clotting disorders, and pregnancy.

          <p id="footer-text">Manipulation Under Anesthesia ("MUA") is a multi-specialty approach to treating chronic musculo-skeletal pain. A licensed physician and a licensed chiropractor are both involved in the overall procedure – the physician is solely responsible for determining the medical appropriateness and ordering, as well as administering of anesthesia while the chiropractor is solely responsible for performing the necessary manipulations while the patient is "asleep." Patients should be aware that there is no direct or indirect financial relationship between the physician and chiropractor who are involved in the MUA procedure.
