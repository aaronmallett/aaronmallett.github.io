      <p><img id="doctor-pic" src="images/doctor.jpg">Dr. Robert Klass, a 1989 graduate from New York Chiropractic College, understands back pain. Growing up, he suffered from severe pain due to several malformed vertebrae in his back. During his first semester of college, he threw his back out so badly that he was introduced to his first chiropractor. Inspired by the amazing work his doctor was able to perform, he changed his course of studies to become a chiropractor.<br><br>

Dr. Klass opened his first practice in Queens as soon as he graduated from NYCC. From there, he moved on to treat car accident patients that were unable to get to a traditional office. This inspired him to study a neuro-diagnostic test called Electromyography or EMG/NCS for short. He's concentrated on EMGs for about 15 years.</p>

      <p>
        Approximately seven years ago, Dr. Klass was introduced to Manipulation Under Anesthesia. He was intrigued by the process because of his own personal and professional experiences. After studying MUA for years, he was given the opportunity to teach for Dr. Gordon (one of the most experienced and celebrated professionals in the MUA field) twice. 

      </p>

      <p>
      Dr. Klass has been certified in MUA four times and has completed over 2,500 MUAs. Over the last few years, he has continued his work with both EMGs and MUAs.

          <p id="footer-text">Manipulation Under Anesthesia ("MUA") is a multi-specialty approach to treating chronic musculo-skeletal pain. A licensed physician and a licensed chiropractor are both involved in the overall procedure â€“ the physician is solely responsible for determining the medical appropriateness and ordering, as well as administering of anesthesia while the chiropractor is solely responsible for performing the necessary manipulations while the patient is "asleep." Patients should be aware that there is no direct or indirect financial relationship between the physician and chiropractor who are involved in the MUA procedure. The physician is a Board-certified anesthesiologist and the chiropractor is a licensed practitioner who has received specialized training in how to perform MUA.</p>
