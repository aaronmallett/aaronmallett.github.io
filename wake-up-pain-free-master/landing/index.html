        <h2>Wave Goodbye<br>
  To Chronic Pain!</h2>
        <p>It is all made possible by Manipulation Under Anesthesia or MUA, a multi-specialty approach that allows for a deep tissue massage and deep stretching of the restrictive scar tissue that has formed due to incomplete healing. With the use of minor doses of anesthesia, our practitioner is able to painlessly work out these issues that are otherwise inaccessible to standard in-office care due to unbearable pain.</p>

      <p>Manipulation Under Anesthesia ("MUA") is a multi-specialty approach to treating chronic musculo-skeletal pain. A licensed physician and a licensed chiropractor are both involved in the overall procedure – the physician is solely responsible for determining the medical appropriateness and ordering, as well as administering of anesthesia while the chiropractor is solely responsible for performing the necessary manipulations while the patient is "asleep." Patients should be aware that there is no direct or indirect financial relationship between the physician and chiropractor who are involved in the MUA procedure. The physician is a Board-certified anesthesiologist and the chiropractor is a licensed practitioner who has received specialized training in how to perform MUA. Klass Chiropractic, P.C. does not guarantee or warrant that patients will actually ‘wake up pain

free.’ This is simply a marketing phrase to convey to potential patients who are appropriately 

screened and treated through MUA that they are reasonably likely to see a reduction in their 

pain over time.</p>
